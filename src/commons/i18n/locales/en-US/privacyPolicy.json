  "notOurResponsibility": "IMPORTANT: This application is designed to help students, programmers, analysts, and testers generate valid documents, both masked and unmasked, to test software under development. The generation of masked documents allows for creating data that follows specific formats without exposing sensitive information, ideal for validation tests and simulating real-world scenarios. The generation of unmasked documents produces complete and valid data, useful for functional testing, system integration, and performance evaluation. It is crucial to use the application ethically and responsibly. The generated data should be used in controlled and test environments, always in compliance with privacy and data protection laws and regulations. The application is not responsible for the misuse of the generated information; thus, it is recommended to avoid using real data in insecure contexts and always prefer fictitious or masked data to ensure information security."
